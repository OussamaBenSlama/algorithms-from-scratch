As an AI Research Engineer and a competitive programmer, I want to engage myself with this public repository to implement the most well-known AI architectures and foundational algorithms, believing that **creating innovative things requires you to know what already exists**.

This repository represents a collection of **from-scratch implementations** of essential **Deep Learning architectures** and **Core Data Structures & Algorithms**.

All implementations are written by myself using my own logic to better understand how things work under the hood.
